## Simple Express ACL Middleware

Simple ACL middleware that works well with JWT and Passport's JWT strategy

## Install

`$ npm install --save simple-express-acl`

## Usage

**Looks for an array of user role's in `req.user.roles`**

If `admin` is found in `req.user.roles`, that is considered a __Super Role__ that has access to all resources, regardless of rule definitions.

If middleware `acl.check` is defined on an Express route, and the user role is not defined in the role definitions, access will be **denied** by default.

#### Sample Express `router.js` file

```
import acl from 'simple-express-acl'

// Set custom YML file with rules
acl.setRules( __dirname + '/config/acl.yml' )

// Set rules from an object
acl.setRules( rulesObject )

// Set super role (default: admin)
acl.superRole = 'root'

// Set unauthorized response status (default: 401)
acl.responseStatus = 404

// Set unauthorized response
acl.response = {
    status:  'error',
    message: 'You do not have access mister...'
}

/**
 *    Express Routes
 */

import { Router } from 'express'
const router = new Router()

router.use( '/user', acl.check, require('./controllers/user.js') )
```

#### Sample `acl.yml`:
> Place in the `root` directory of your project by default

```
